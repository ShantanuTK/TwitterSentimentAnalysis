# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
Uses machine learning algorithms to give a sentimental analysis of the live tweets streaming from twitter.
The algorithms are little negatively biased as the data on which it was trained was of movie reviews and negative reviews tend
to be more negative than positive reviews tend to be positive.
